## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner.

See the [vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for more information.

### `yarn build`
