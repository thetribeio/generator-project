## Description

This starter kit is a bit different from others, since this a generator which encapsulates several starter kit. 

At theTribe we have different needs over different technologies, but some part of the boilerplate is shared across all project regardless of the choosen stack.

This generator is our answer to mutualise them while having the flexibility to choose the appropriate front end and backend. 

We use Yeoman under the hood, which allow us to provide a CLI experience with prompts where you will be asked 
a few questions to choose the stack you want to use and some variables for your project identity


### Current features 

The current MVP covers the most used technologies which are:

* Front-End Architecture: you can choose between `Create React App` and `NextJs` as a boilerplate app


* Backend-End Architecture: you can choose between `Node` and `Symfony` (Node backend comes with Express and TypeORM)
  

* Containerization in dev environment with `docker-compose` 


* Provision/Deployment automation with `Ansible`


* Instance Management with `Terraform`

  
* Continuous Integration with `CircleCI`
