This starter kit is a bit different from others, since this a generator which encapsulates several starter kit. 

At theTribe we have different needs over different technologies, but some part of the boilerplate is shared across all project regardless of the choosen stack.

This generator is our answer to mutualise them while having the flexibility to choose the appropriate front end and backend.

Node backend comes with Express and TypeORM
  
* Containerization In dev environment with docker-compose 

* Provision/Deployment automation with Ansible
